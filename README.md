# graphs
An app where there can be applied some of the most used graphs algorithms on a drawn graph.<br>
This app has been made using **Maven** and **Java Swing**.<br>

**App features:**<br>
-> Draw an undirect/directed/undirect with weight/directed with weight graph.<br><br>
-> Draw the map of the Luxembourg City where there can be used, for finding the path from two selected nodes, Dijkstra's algorithm or Bellmanâ€“Ford algorithm.<br><br>
-> DFS<br><br>
-> BFS<br><br>
-> Kosaraju's Algorithm<br><br>
-> Topological Sort<br><br>
-> Arborescence Check<br><br>
-> Root Node Check<br><br>
-> Prim's MST<br><br>
-> Kruskal's MST<br><br>
-> Boruvka's MST<br><br>
-> Ford-Fulkerson
