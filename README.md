# graphs
An app where there can be applied some of the most used graphs algorithms on a drawn graph.

App features:<br>
-> Draw an undirect/directed/undirect with weight/directed with weight graph.<br>
-> Draw the map of the Luxembourg City where there can be used, for finding the path from two selected nodes, Dijkstra's algorithm or Bellmanâ€“Ford algorithm.<br>
-> DFS<br>
-> BFS<br>
-> Kosaraju's Algorithm<br>
-> Topological Sort<br>
-> Arborescence Check<br>
